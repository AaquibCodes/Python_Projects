NOTE - The code is for the following statement.

Statement:-
The task is to create an “Online Library Management System”. For this, you have to create a library class that includes the following methods:

Displaybook() : To display the available books
Lendbook(): To lend a book to a user
Addbook(): To add a book to the library
Returnbook(): To return the book to the library.

As you have created a library class, now you will create an object and pass the following parameters in the constructor.

My_Library=Library(listofbooks, library_name)

After that, create a main function and run an infinite while loop that asks the users for their input that whether they want to display, lend, add or return a book.
