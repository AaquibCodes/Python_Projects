"Stone Paper Scissor."

Most of you must already be familiar with the game. Still, I will provide you with a brief description.

This is a two-player game where each player chooses one object.  As we know, there are three objects, Stone, Paper, and Scissor. So, the result will be 

Stone vs. Scissor: Stone kills the Paper hence wins.
Paper vs. Stone: The Paper will kill the stone, hence a point for Paper
Scissor vs. Paper: Scissor will kill the paper and win.

In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.
