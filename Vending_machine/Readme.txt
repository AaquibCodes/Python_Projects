This a little advance Vending machine, you should have the knowledge of Object Oriented concepts to understand the code.

Whereas, the functionality is pretty simple.

The Vending machine stores 100 coca-cola cans, each can costs for Rs 20 (you can ofcourse change it from the code)

The user has to input how many cans you want, then it will display the bill amount.
If you pay more money than the bill amount then the change is returned.
If you pay more money than the bill amount then a message "You dont have enough money" is returned.

Every successful transaction is logged in Vending_machine_log.txt along with datetime, no. of cans requested , money given and change returned.

This program only accepts integer data types for another data type it raises a ValueError.
