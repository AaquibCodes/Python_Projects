This is a GUI -graphical user interface program developed with the help of Tkinter module.

I have used a free Weather API that provides a detailed weather for the city asked.

This program requires your own weather API key which you can get from - https://openweathermap.org/.

Once you get your API put in Line 5 of the code where it says Note, without paranthesis. 

I have provided a JPG of how it looks.

Note - IF you have a more efficient way, please provide your inputs.
